Our competition can be identified as any university's co-op job site. Some examples of these are CSM(Career Services Manager at the University of Toronto Scarborough), CLN(Career Learning Network at the University of Toronto) and TalentEgg.

Our product is different because it is meant for all students in Ontario looking for a job, whereas the competition above is restricted to students attending respective schools. TalentEgg is for all students but it does not allow students to directly apply through their site, it only provides links to employer sites.  

Our product is better than the competition above because we are allowing any student in Ontario to access our job listings board. We are also providing a place for employers to post their jobs where all students can view them, rather than having to post the same job on multiple schools' job boards. The competitors didn't focus on this because they wanted to provide to their own students and customize their job board for their school's purposes.
