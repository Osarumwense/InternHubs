## Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.


We initially committed the binary database files and .pyc files, which lead to a lot of git merge conflicts. To fix this we created a .gitignore file and agreed not to commit these binary files. Trying to learn a new framework (Django) was also hard for many and took up a lot of our time, we could have made something better using Java, which everyone knows. 

Also, online meetings for the first sprint didn’t work as planned since people weren’t online in the chat at all times, however we switched to in person meetings which worked well. In the very early stages we used Facebook messenger but this didn’t work since we wanted specific channels and the ability to notify everyone at once.

## Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.

We used slack to create multiple channels which facilitated to communicate separately and therefore cause less confusion between the discussions online. We also used different branches on git and checked each other's pull request before finally merging to the master which helped us save time by not debugging. 

We also followed the Material Design Lite guidelines and referred to them when creating all components of our website. This made our website look very nice while we transitioned between pages. We also used Django template extending/inheritance to ensure that we weren’t repeating too much code between different pages. This lead to each html file looking clean and only having one responsibility.

Given that we continued with this project, we would firstly consider our available user stories and decide as a team which is more crucial or beneficial to our website. As a team, we would like to discuss how to tackle implementing a feature or function, furthermore, we would think about difficulties that may arise while we are coding, as well as, when we have finished coding. Once we are on the same page, we assign tasks depending on what we were assigned to do initially in the project (front end/ or back end). Additionally, we would break the tasks down even further so that it is doable for a team member, depending on how challenging the feature is. Throughout the developing phase, we would like to communicate with one another to see if we are progressing at a good pace, or we need to increase productivity.  To do this, we have channels on slack so that we can post content to a channel that is either relative to the team in general or more specifically to  team members. After developing, we extensively test it for bugs and errors by conventional testing and debugging methods, or playing scenarios as a user on the website. We also evaluate the final feature(s) to see if we can add more functionality to enhance user experience, or remove portions that are unnecessary that complicate user interaction.
