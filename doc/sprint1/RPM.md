# Release Goals
Technology planning to use for this sprint: MongoDB, python, html/css

## User Stories for this sprint: 
1. As a Student, I want to be able to login to a student account, so that I can perform student functions.
2. As a Student, I want to be able to sort the job postings by required skill level so that I can apply to jobs suited for me.
3. As an Employer, I want to be able to post open positions for students to view.

## Features that will be implemented to satisfy the user stories: 1. Creating the schema for the job objects, loading the database
with mock jobs and then using python script to display all the jobs in sorted order. This will satisfy user story no 1 and 3.
2. Each job will be tagged with a skill therefore making it easier to be able to search jobs according to the users skill level. This
feature will satisfy user story no 2.
