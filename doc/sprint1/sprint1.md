Meeting(s):
 
 Scrum Master:
 Attendees: Nathan, Osaru, Aiyaz, Sal, Omid, Venkada, Ewen
 Time: June 16, 2017
 
Conclusion(s):
  
  - Needed a way to split work to develop essential yet basic software
  - One question was how to make front end portion for the user (a student) to see,
    so we decided to plan some concepts of what someone may see when entering the site
    for the first time, and broke it down what features to code
  - The other aspect we wanted to start is having a database, therefore we were considering
    different applications to use, and agreeing to use Mongo
  - We needed the database to be filled with fictitious job postings so that we could see
    these postings in the front-end portion of our website

Backlog:

  Overview: Implement the ability for students to view available job postings. The core idea that we
  want to develop is to populate the database with job post objects and be available to take requests to
  display the job(s).

  User Stories:

    Priority: 60, Size: 2
