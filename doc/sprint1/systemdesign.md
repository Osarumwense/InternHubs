## Software Architecture 

![Software Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/UTSCCSCC01/Better-Jobs/blob/master/images/design/systemarch.png "Software Architecture Diagram")

SQLite: used for persistant data  
Python/Django: used for the backend to process information from the controller and to communicate with the database  
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: used to get requests from users and communicate with the backend   

### System Decomposition
Users will interact with the UI and we will use JavaScript to send information needed to our Python/Django backend, which will then reteieve information and/or update the database if needed. Next, data is transferred back to the frontend and displayed for the user to see. Invalid user input will be taken care of at all steps in our process, through the frontend, backend, and even the database attribute restrictions. Any errors or further failures will be reported to the user in the form of a user friendly message.
