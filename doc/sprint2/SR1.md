#### Participants: 
- Aiyaz
- Nathan
- Salman
- Venkada
- Ewen
- Osaru
- Omid

### Unfinished Tasks:
- No unfinished tasks from Sprint1

### Good Practices:

1. Team collaboration on slack:

   Separated channels for backend, front end, sprint planning, and github updates.

2. Regularly scheduled meetings. 

3. Workflow was good. 

## Bad Practices:

1. Dividing everything into tasks would be better next time, instead of doing everything at once.

2. Our time management could have been better as we started pretty late.

3. Great Adaptability: We learned new technologies and irst time working with databased. Although Mongo did not work out as planned, we were flexible and adaptable enough and SQL Lite 3 instead.
