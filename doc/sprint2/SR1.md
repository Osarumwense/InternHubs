### Unfinished Tasks:
- No unfinished tasks from Sprint1

### Good Practices:

1. Team collaboration on slack:

   Separated channels for backend, front end, sprint planning, and github updates.

2. Regularly scheduled meetings. 

3. Workflow was good:

   We adopted a workflow where a developer creates a new branch for each new feature or funtionality they would like to work on. Once they are finished they submit a Pull request for their work to be merged in and once reviewed and deemed up to code standards, their code is then merged in by another team member.

4. Great Adaptability:

   We learned new technologies and first time working with databased. Although Mongo did not work out as planned, we were flexible and adaptable enough and SQL Lite 3 instead.

## Bad Practices:

1. Dividing everything into tasks would be better next time, instead of doing everything at once.

2. Our time management could have been better as we started pretty late.
