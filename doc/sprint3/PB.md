# Product Backlog

Changes: we removed the employer controlling job visibility story, and added the search jobs story(1) as well as the navbar story(8)
we also recalculated priorities for the remaining stories.

We used the scale 10-80 to represent priority, and the scale 1-21 (fibonacci numbers) for size estimates.

1. **Priority 70, Size: 3**
> As a Student, I want to be able to search for jobs in a text box, so that I can easily filter the list of jobs
