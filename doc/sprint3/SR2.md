### Unfinished Tasks:
- No unfinished tasks from Sprint2

### Good Practices:

1. Worked to improve UI for Sprint Demo:

   Spent a lot of time on the front end to show off features which were previously shown using command line.
   
2. Completed tasks quickly:

   Worked together and got a lot of work done quickly.

3. Worked on major features:

   Got front-end and back-end to work together.

4. Task assignments were spread out:

   Tasks were assigned to keep each individual busy and not overwhelming.

## Bad Practices:

1. We need to decide exactly what files to commit to avoid conflict (ex. binary files)

2. Could have done more user stories.

3. Need to use channels on slack more to better coordinate everyone and keep updated
