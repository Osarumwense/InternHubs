19 year old John Smith is a university student currently in his 2nd year studying computer science at University of Toronto. John
is very experienced with computers, having first used one when he was 5, when his parents bought a family PC. Ever since 
then, John has been fascinated by computers.

John spends most of his day at school, either going to lectures or doing coursework inbetween classes. John has a lot of free 
time where he has nothing to do and he feels that he is not being productive. A part time job would help fill out his schedule.

John has a lot of friends in the co-op computer science program, and most of them have found jobs through the university's co-op 
job listings. However John is not in co-op and does not have access to such listings, making his job search more difficult than 
his peers.

John has no previous work experience, only volunteer work at local soup kitchens and animal shelters. He hopes to find an
introductory job to learn how the professional world works and to build work experience for his resume.
