# process.md

Our group got together during the lectures. We first communicated on Facebook, before moving to Slack after our meeting. In our first meeting we decided on what we were going to do for the project. The decision making process was simple as none of us had anything in mind going into our first meeting, so we agreed on the first thing that came up - to create a jobs listing site.
	
We only met in person twice for sprint0, but kept in contact online through Slack.
