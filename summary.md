**Project Objectives**  
Our objective is to build a job portal which is accessible by many students(both co-op and non co-op) from various universities and high schools across Ontario and also giving access to employers who are willing to employ students of Ontario. Admins should be able to manage interactions between students and employers. 
**Key Users**   
Students(co-op, non co-op and high school)    
Employers (searching for potential employees)   
Admin (manage the site)  

**Scenarios:**  
* A student must be able to find jobs that are similar to their level of experience and similar to their skills using the search function.
* A student, employer or admin is able to register using their email address.  
* Students are able to get recommendations from their previous employers, endorsements from previous colleagues, upload documents (i.e resumes, cover letter, transcripts) and apply to jobs using any one of the documents.    
* Admins are able to review jobs that are posted, delete posts or applications which are not professional enough, able to boot students and employers that do not meet guidelines, reschedule interviews according to students availability and employers availability.  
* Employers are able to search potential candidates according to skills if the student has their profile in public mode, post jobs, accept or reject applications, sort through potential candidates using a search keyword, sort through their postings.    
* An employer who came to interview but didnt find the interviewee should be able to give a thumbs down on students profile.  


**Principles:**
* Design the site in an elegant way to make sure students are able easily access jobs that are suited for them. 
* Design the site in an elegant way to make sure employers are able to view potential employees and also post appropriate jobs that are vacant in their organization.
* Design the site in an elegant way to make sure admins are able to manage the site and posts. 
* Code and test properly to ensure all of the requirements are met and also let users easily perform their jobs.
